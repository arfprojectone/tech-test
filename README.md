# Project Overview

This repo contains automated testing for UI Testing, API Testing and Performance Testing.
The Testing framework used for UI and API automation is Cypress, and K6 is used for performance testing.

### 💻 Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arfprojectone/tech-test.git
```

## How to Run the Tests

### UI Automation Testing (Cypress)

#### ▶️ Running via GUI
```bash
npx cypress open
```
- Perform End-to-End (E2E) Testing:
- Choose a browser
- Select Login.cy.js

#### ▶️ Running via Headless
```bash
npx cypress run
```

### API Automation Testing (Cypress)

#### ▶️ Running via Headless
```bash
npx cypress run
```

### Performance Testing (K6)

#### ▶️ Running K6
```bash
- k6 run --vus 5 --duration 30s users_performance_test.js
```

### Dependencies & Setup Instructions

Make sure to install the following tools:
- Node.js & npm: Required for Cypress setup.
- Cypress: Test runner for UI and API automation.
- cypress-xpath: (Optional) For using XPath in Cypress selectors.
- K6: Performance testing tool.

Follow the steps above for each type of test to get everything running.

#### 🔧 Pre Condition for UI Automation Testing (Cypress)
```bash
npm init -y
npm install cypress --save-dev
npm install -D cypress-xpath
```

#### 🔧 Pre Condition for API Automation Testing (Cypress)
```bash
npm init -y
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

#### 🔧 Pre Condition for Performance Testing (K6)
```bash
brew install k6
```

Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly by following the setup instructions for each testing type above.

### Any assumptions made during testing
- UI tests assume that the target application is available and accessible in a testable state.
- API tests assume endpoints are stable, reachable, and return expected results.
- Performance testing is assumed to be run in a stable network and server environment for consistent results.
